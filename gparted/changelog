gparted (0.22.0-1~getdeb1) trusty; urgency=medium

  * New upstream version
    Release Notes
    -------------
      The big news with this release of GParted is support for
      unpartitioned whole disk drives.  With unpartitioned drive support,
      GParted can now recognize and also format disk devices that do not
      contain a partition table.  Another new feature is support for GPT
      partition names.  This feature enables setting and viewing names on
      GPT partitions.  Also included are bug fixes and language
      translation updates.

    ### Key changes include:

      * Add read and write support for unpartitioned whole disk devices
      * Add read and write support for GPT partition names

    Bug Fixes
    ---------
      * Add support for GPT partition names (#741424)
        - Fix double quote error creating XFS file systems (#744108)
      * Make swap usage match figures reported by swapon -s (#742647)
      * Correct dialog title displaying libparted exceptions (#743825)
      * GParted cannot recognise LVM signature on unpartitioned drive
      (#741430)
      * Nilfs2 file system is unusable on RHEL/CentOS 6 (#742741)
      * Add unpartitioned drive read-write support (#743181)
      * If available use udisks2-inhibit to prevent automounting (#745349)

gparted (0.21.0-1~getdeb1) trusty; urgency=medium

  * New upstream version
    Release Notes
    -------------
     This release of GParted includes enhancements, bug fixes and
     language translation updates. One fix involves an error introduced
     in 0.15.0 whereby GParted's internal block copy has an off by one
     sector bug when the source is before the destination; and the copy
     is performed backwards from high block to low block. The problem
     results in incorrect last sectors in partitions.

    ### Key changes include:

     * Fix off by one sector error in GParted internal block copy
     * Add support for ext4 on RHEL/CentOS 5.x
     * Remove unnecessary duplicate actions when resizing a partition

  * New upstream release 0.16.1 
    Closes: #701012, #694689

    GParted 0.16.1

    This release includes another critical bug fix for a potential crash that
    might cause loss of data while moving or copying a partition.

    Key changes include:

      Avoid another crash in GParted when moving or copying partitions

    GParted 0.16.0

    This release of GParted includes a critical bug fix for a crash that might
    cause loss of data while moving or copying a partition. Also included are
    bug fixes, enhancements and language translation updates.

    Key changes include:

      Avoid crash in GParted when moving or copying partitions
      Fix GParted scans forever blank disk in virtual machine
      Add support for f2fs file system

    GParted 0.15.0

    The big news with this release is the ability to track live updates of
    command execution progress. This should help with determining the status
    of long running commands by enabling users to see the live command output
    in the details section of the apply operations window. This new ability is
    implemented by a fundamental code change that spawns commands to run
    asynchronously. Also included in this release are bug fixes and language
    translation updates.

    Key changes include:

      Live tracking of command progress output in the details log
      Move operations are twice as fast as prior versions
      Proper cancel support added
      Volume label length now based on file system type
      Unallocated space is selected by default
      New key bindings added:
      - Insert --> New Partition
      - Ctrl+Enter --> Apply All Operations

    GParted 0.14.1

    This release of GParted includes some important bug fixes and some
    language translation updates.

    Key changes include:

      Fix Linux software RAID device detection
      Fix logical partition grow overlaps extended partition end

    GParted 0.14.0

    The big news with this release of GParted is the ability to move, resize,
    check, create, and delete physical volumes under Logical Volume Management
    (lvm2 pv). Also included are bug fixes and language translation updates.

    Key changes include:

      Add LVM PV read-write support
      Fix crash when pressing Esc in dialogs with number entry

    GParted 0.13.1

    This release of GParted fixes a failure to mount rescued file systems
    larger than 2 GiB or file systems that start after the initial 2 GiB of
    the disk device. Also includes language translations updates.

    Key changes include:

      Fix failure creating read-only view of rescued file systems

    GParted 0.13.0

    This release of GParted adds the ability to show if partition size differs
    from file system size. This new feature enables you to identify
    unallocated space within a partition and can suggest how you can put this
    space to good use. Also included are bug fixes and language translation
    updates.

    Key changes include:

      Show difference if partition size differs from file system size
      Avoid end partition overlap when resizing extended partition
