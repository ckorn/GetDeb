    Core Changes:
    - Connection: Implemented IRCv3 tags/commands/membership support

    replace other emotes
    - FFZ: Switched to new API (and showing more info about the emotes)

    found, which item you are at while cycling through results)
    - Added completion for emotes (Shift-TAB)
    - Added completion for setting names (TAB when using after setting

    - Added completion for some commands (TAB after /)

    settings or via the /customCompletion command
