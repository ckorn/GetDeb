chatty (0.8.7-1~getdeb1) xenial; urgency=medium

  * New upstream version
    ### Communities / Channel Info
    - Added support for selecting several communities in Admin Dialog
    - Removed F hotkey for toggling Community favorites (because that can
    interfere
      with searching the list), use Alt+F instead
    - Updated Channel Info Dialog to show several communities (in overflow
    menu if
      there is not enough space)
    - More info updated when hovering over history graph in Channel Info
    Dialog
      (uptime, communities, stream type)

    ### Notifications
    - Don't match own messages by default, but added option to do so anyway
    - Added option to only trigger on messages containing bits
    - Added text matching for Stream Status and Subscriber Notifications
    - Added separate dialog to edit text matching pattern, including some
    basic help
    - Prevent channel tab color changing from own messages (by username)

    ### TAB Completion
    - Added settings to what TAB and Shift-TAB should complete, but always
    complete
      to username when using the @ prefix
    - Added completion of Custom Command names
    - Reorganized settings

    ### Custom Commands / Moderation
    - Added $lower function to make text lowercase
    - Improved error output, showing the place the error occured more
    conveniently
    - Made function parsing more lenient, so that you can use a replacement
    in
      the first function parameter (if it starts with "$"), which usually
      would
      require an identifier (e.g. "$lower(1)" or "$lower($(1))")
    - AutoMod: Made name of filtered messages in chat clickable, so you can
    open the
      context menu or User Info Dialog to approve/deny a message
    - Added special commands /Automod_approve and /Automod_deny that can be
    used to
      position the Approve/Deny buttons in the User Info Dialog

    ### Other Settings Stuff
    - Highlights/Ignore: Added "re*:" prefix (matching anywhere in message,
    except
      of whole message, so "re*:abc" and "re:.*abc.*" would be equivalent)
    - Added "Test"-button to some matcher settings (e.g. Highlights) where
    you can
      test if the pattern you entered matches a text
    - Added setting to close User Info Dialog when clicking on button
    (enabled by
      default to keep previous behaviour, but can be disabled now)
    - Added ability to add Livestreamer fallback quality options
    - Added "Edit all entries" button to some list settings, which allows all
      entries to be edited in one editbox (separated by newlines)

    ### Other Improvements
    - Vodcasts are now marked with "[VOD]" in several places, and also made
    the
      Channel Info Dialog history graph line color grey for Vodcasts
    - Set Admin/Followers Dialog to first joined channel, if already open
    - Don't immediately remove streams from Live Streams Dialog on request
    error
    - Added "/userinfo <name>" command to open specific User Info Dialog
    - Live Streams List: Added hotkeys for join selected (Enter), open
    Channel Info
      (Space) and open context menu (Context Menu Button)
    - Channel Info Dialog: Added ESC hotkey to close
    - Removed message type from Tray Notifications, which should allow Chatty
    icon
      to show up on them on some OS
    - Minor memory usage improvement in regards to Twitch Emotes metadata
    - Show Twitch Charity messages
    - Updated help
