    Main release 0.4.2b

      □ Linux: now building with Qt 4.6.3 under ubuntu 8.04.4; unlike Fritzing
        0.4.1, this download should be compatible with ubuntu releases 8.04.4
        and up
      □ very experimental (use at your own risk) "speed hack" added to trace
        menu: speeds up Fritzing when there are a lot (~50 or more) of
        interconnected parts in a sketch
      □ experimental ratsnest wire functionality: double click to create a
        trace; drag to create a trace with a bendpoint; delete to delete
        corresponding wires in other views
      □ jumper items: rotate and align to grid
      □ on double-sided boards, right-clicking a trace gives an option to move
        the trace from one side of the board to the other
      □ bug fixes: a crash bug that occured sometimes on one-sided boards when
        hand- or auto- routing, and the linux32 70% crash
      □ new parts: lilypad, arduino pro mini (thanks Lionel)

    mac manual trace wrong color bug fix updated german translation

    Feb. 1, 2009

    Interim release 0.1.15b

    draw traces directly in pcb view traces aren't automatically cleared when
    there are changes to the board (deleting parts or connections still removes
    traces) export-etchable (was export diy) bug fixes simple text notes
    spanish translation (thanks to Kurt Badelt) some new and improved parts
    check for updates new examples

    Jan. 21, 2009

    Interim release 0.1.14b

    Jan. 20, 2009

    Interim release 0.1.13b

    two bug fixes around delete:
      □ delete followed by view switch was crashing
      □ delete followed by undo in pcb view was generating phantom parts

    Jan. 18, 2009

    Interim release 0.1.12b

      □ fixed some cases in which the autorouter was incorrectly unable to
        route a trace
      □ after the autorouter completes a trace, a clean-up function tries to
        eliminate some of the unnecessary zig-zags
      □ the connection currently being traced is now highlighted
      □ there's a 'stop this trace' button (next to the cancel autoroute
        button). if the autorouter gets stuck for too long on a particular
        trace (or you can see from the highlight that the trace would be
        blocked), clicking 'stop this trace' turns the current trace into a
        jumper wire, and the autorouter goes on to the next trace.

    Jan. 17, 2009

    Interim release 0.1.11b

    New stuff

      □ Bill of materials export (to text file)

        wires)
      □ Autorouter: Routing stopped before completion (certain parts were
        mistakenly treated as having buses)
      □ Autorouter: Shift-click to remove bendpoint on traces crash
      □ Export DIY: Wires not lined up propertly with parts they were connected
        to
      □ Export DIY: Certain parts disappeared from export
      □ Delete/undo bug causing view desynchronization
      □ Part bug fixes on Optocoupler, Transistors

      □ ...and a number of further fixes and enhancements

    Dec. 23, 2008

    Main release 0.1b

    The "Fritzmas" release is the first version of the new Fritzing that we
    tend to call stable. We put a lot of effort into polishing, bug fixing,
    performance improvements and future-proofness (which also means that
    sketches created with older versions are not compatible with the new one).
    We intend to circulate it on a wider base and are encouraging you to try it
    out on more serious projects.

      □ (Hopefully) clearer UI: We put some effort in making the "three
        views"-concept more understandable, with a new view switcher, miniature
        views in the navigator, cross-view icons in the inspector, and a new
        help text on opening Fritzing for the first time.
      □ New website: Based on a new underlying web framework (Django), the new
        website is the foundation for the upcoming social features. Soon you
        will be able to share projects and custom parts.
      □ Refined .fz file format that is (more likely) future-compatible
      □ New parts (big potentiometer, batteries, dc motor) and lots of clean-up
      □ Five new example sketches, including a Fritzmas surprise
      □ Improved synchronization of views (especially for schematic view)
      □ New overall design and styling, with much more space for your sketch
      □ Big speed-up for the breadboard
      □ Export DIY is now vector-based and faster
      □ Improved autorouter
      □ Breadboard parts resized to be closer to actual size
      □ Parts editor connectors view allows for zooming and panning
      □ Connectors, connections, buses, and wires cleaned up
      □ Autorouting can now be undone
      □ ..and many more big and small bug fixes
