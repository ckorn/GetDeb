  [ Per Olofsson ]
  * Remove texlive-latex-base dependency from lyx-common, as it already
    depends on tex-common via ${misc:Depends}, and that's all that's
    really necessary.
  * Remove debian/lyx-common.postrm. It was only deleting /etc/lyxrc,
    which is not necessary since the file is deleted in preinst.
  * Don't remove profiling.py, there's no reason.

  [ Sven Hoexter ]
  * Add patches/prefer-xdg-open. Sadly there are still issue with xdg-open
    in other Linux distributions forcing upstream to rewoke the patch added
    with LyX 1.5.3 again in LyX 1.5.4.
    http://www.mail-archive.com/lyx-devel@lists.lyx.org/msg133878.html

lyx (1.5.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Sven Hoexter ]
  * New upstream release should resolve the following problems:
    + Document class "article (AMS)" no longer works properly. Closes: #448260
    + lyx-qt ignores "screen DPI" setting in Preferences. Closes: #316535
    + Lyx 1.5.2-1 crashes at startup on LANG=pt_BR.utf8. Closes: #453520

    Juergen Spitzmueller both are now included upstream.

  * Added a note to the NEWS.Debian file about the removal of the old
    -qt and -xforms frontend packages. Closes: #452888
  * Standards-Version: 3.7.3 - no changes required.
  * Added lyx-common.preinst script. Remove /etc/lyxrc (if existing)
    which is left from the LyX 1.4.x packages and would be otherwise
    left on the system even if you purge the latest package.
    Closes: #454713
  * Added "-- -Z bzip2" to dh_builddeb so that we use bzip2 compression
    for the binary packages instead of gzip.
  * Removed the explicit "Encoding=UTF-8" from lyx.desktop because it's
    deprecated now.

  [ Per Olofsson ]
  * Disable assertions per upstream advice. More specifically, don't pass
    --enable-assertions but let configure select whatever is the default
    (only enables assertions for prereleases and devel versions).
    Closes: #410175
  * Add -Wl,-z,defs to make sure there are no undefined symbols.
  * Remove old NEWS entry about /etc/lyxrc and lyxrc.dist, since they
    are both gone now.
  * Reformat NEWS.Debian to comply with Dev Ref.
  * Change Vcs-Browser. viewsvn is a lot nicer than WebSVN.

lyx (1.1.4-7) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * NMU requested by Michael Meskes <meskes@debian.org>
  * Applied patch-1.1.4fix3:
    This patch fixes the following problems in LyX 1.1.4fix2 (these are in
    fact bugs of LyX 1.1.4 which were not fixed by the 1.1.4fix[12] patches):
   
    * LyX often crashed after repeated use of the backspace key. This problem
      actually existed since long ago in the program, but did not strike very
      often before version 1.1.4. This is probably the main reason why
      you will want to apply this patch.
    * error insets were not removed correctly, which caused the removal or
      nearby characters in the documents. This is a serious problem too.
    * filenames for images in docbook mode were truncated
    * font tags for SGML output were wrong.
    * -lintl was not added on the link list when compiling on system
      which have gettext installed, but not in libc. 
    * one header file contained C++ comments, whereas it is compiled with a
      C compiler.

lyx (1.1.4-3) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Applied patch-1.1.4fix2:
  * This patch fixes the following problems in LyX 1.1.4fix1 (these are in
  * fact bugs of LyX 1.1.4 which were not fixed by the 1.1.4fix1 patch):
  * - fix build problems on some architectures ('fl_gc' symbol not found)
  * - fix warnings about missing return type in X headers for some
      gcc/egcs versions.
  * - fix parsing of LaTeX log files, where some errors got unnoticed.
  * - add support for textclasses with more than 128 layouts (yes some
      people do that!)
  * - fix bug with filenames containing more that one "." (for example,
      a.b.lyx was exported to a.ps).
  * - fix partly bug with bibtex files located in the directory of the
      document (now using an absolute path works).
  * - fix bug in math editor, where greek letters (and some other
      symbols) had too much spacing around them.
  * - remove function buffer-previous from binding files, since it is not
      implemented.
  * Added icon to menu (closes:Bug#58739).
  * Made lintian clean.

lyx (1.1.4-2) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Applied patch-1.1.4fix1:
  *	The purpose of this patch is to provide some simple fixes to LyX
  *	1.1.4 to ease the wait until the next stable release. It should
  *	probably be applied to binary distributions of LyX 1.1.4, since it
  *	offers better stability.
  *
  *	This patch fixes the following problems in LyX 1.1.4:
  *
  *	- fix character \"{e} in latin1 encoding
  *	- fix problem when running latex on files which have accented
  *	   characters in their names  
  *	- add support for dvi previewers which do not support the -paper
  *	   option (like yap on NT)
  *	- fix oneside/twoside options in Layout->Document
  *	- fix crash when trying to select a layout which does not exist
