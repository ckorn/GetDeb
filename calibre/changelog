calibre (0.7.2+dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New major upstream version. See http://calibre-ebook.com/new-in/seven for
    details.
  * Refresh patches to apply cleanly.
  * debian/control: Bump python-cssutils to >= 0.9.7~ to ensure the existence
    of the CSSRuleList.rulesOfType attribute. This makes epub conversion work
    again. (Closes: #584756)
  * Add debian/local/calibre-mount-helper: Simple and safe replacement for
    upstream's calibre-mount-helper, using udisks --mount and eject.
    (Closes: #584915, LP: #561958)

calibre (0.6.54+dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release. Please see http://calibre.kovidgoyal.net/new_in_6/

  * Overhaul and update the packaging for the new release's build system.
    Changes taken from the Ubuntu branch/package.
  * debian/control: Bump Python dependencies to 2.6, since upstream needs
    it now.
  * debian/rules: Force all hashbang lines to #!/usr/bin/python2.6, as long as
    2.5 is still the default in Debian.
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.8.4.

calibre (0.5.14+dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * debian/rules, get-orig-source: Do not unpack newly generated orig tarball
    if we don't have unpackaged upstream sources in the tree (such as when
    building with bzr-buildpackage).

calibre (0.5.11+dfsg-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/rules, debian/control: Remove upstream shipped copy of
    python-django-tagging. Depend on the package instead.
    (Closes: #528091)
  * debian/control: Use my @debian.org Uploaders: address.
  * debian/control: Bump Standards-Version (no changes necesssary).

calibre (0.5.11+dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * debian/control: Drop Ubuntu specific python-mechanize binary dependency as
    well (brown paperbag). (Closes: #525612)

 -- Martin Pitt <mpitt@debian.org>  Sun, 10 May 2009 21:00:35 +0200

calibre (0.5.9+dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release. (Closes: #525339)
  * manpages-installation.patch: Encode generated manpages as UTF-8, to avoid
    UnicodeDecodeErrors when writing them out to files.
  * debian/control: Demote calibre dependency of calibre-bin to Recommends:,
    which is sufficient and avoids a circular dependency. (Closes: #522059)
  * debian/control: Drop build dependency help2man, current version does not
    need it any more.
  * debian/control: Drop versioned build dependency on python-mechanize,
    current sid version is enough.
  * debian/rules: Copy "setup.py install" command from cdbs'
    python-distutils.mk, since the current version broke this. This is a
    hackish workaround until #525436 gets fixed.
  * debian/rules: Drop using $(wildcard ), use `ls`; the former does not work
    any more.
